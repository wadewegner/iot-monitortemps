================

This project will help facilitate the acquisition of temperature information from temp sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi into Salesforce. There are a few technologies at play:

* Raspberry Pi running Debian Wheezy
* High Temp Waterpoof DS18B20 Digital Sensor ([link](https://www.adafruit.com/products/381)]
* Python
* Cloud AMQP (a RabbitMQ service)
* Postgres
* Heroku Connect
* Salesforce & Force.com

It is my intent to better document and describe not only how this works soon, but how you can run it yourself.

For now, enjoy perusing the code.
